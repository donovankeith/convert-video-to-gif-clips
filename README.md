```

## üèÅ Quickstart

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

DO NOT USE WITH REALLY LONG VIDEOS

1. Trim long movies down to the sections you're most interested in.

### üìã Instructions

1. Copy this script into a directory where you want to convert your files.
2. Open terminal and `cd` to the directory.
3. `python3 convert-mp4-to-gif-clips.py -i INPUT.mp4`
4. Navigate to the new `gifs/` directory next to your input file.
5. Use Quick Look (spacebar on Mac) and your up/down arrow keys to quickly audition the clips you want to use.
6. Ctrl+C to copy, then Ctrl+V to paste in Google Slides or your

## Usage

```console
python convert-mp4-to-gif-clips.py -i <input_file> -o <output_file> -spacing <clip_spacing_sec> -duration <clip_duration_sec>
```

### Options

- -i, --input_file: Path to the input video file. Default is 'BOX.mp4'
- -o, --output_file: Path to the output gif file. If not provided, it will save the gif clips to a 'gifs' directory next to the input file.
- -spacing, --clip_spacing: Spacing between clips in seconds. Default is 1 second.
- -duration, --clip_duration: Duration of each clip in seconds. Default is 3 seconds.

### Examples

- Convert 'video.mp4' to gif clips, save the clips in the 'gifs' directory and use the default spacing and duration

```console
python convert-mp4-to-gif-clips.py -i video.mp4
```

- Convert 'video.mp4' to gif clips, save the clips in 'output.gif' and use a spacing of 2 seconds and duration of 5 seconds

```console
python convert-mp4-to-gif-clips.py -i video.mp4 -o output.gif -spacing 2 -duration 5
```

## üóíÔ∏è Note

- The script will validate the input and provide errors with suggestions on how to fix them to the user.
- Spacing should be an int or float value greater that 1/30
- Duration should not exceed 30 as the .gif file will be far too large.
- If the 'gifs' directory doesn't exist it will be created.
- The script will set the width of the gifs to 480 pixels.

## Why?

I teach Motion Design at California Institite of the Arts. It's helpful to breakdown longer animations into shorter clips.
I'm posting this here in case anyone else doing motion design needs to assemble decks/boards featuring the best clips from their own work.

üëÜüèª This project is so incredible that I just had to break it down into a series of 3 second clips so that I could watch each of the transitions over and over again.
